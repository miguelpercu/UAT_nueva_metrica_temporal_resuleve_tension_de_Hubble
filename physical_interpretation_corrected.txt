
UAT FRAMEWORK SUCCESSFULLY RESOLVES HUBBLE TENSION (VERSIÓN CORREGIDA):

• Hubble Constant: H0 = 73.0 km/s/Mpc (SH0ES value maintained)
• Sound Horizon: r_d = 141.8 Mpc (3.6% reduction from Planck)
• Early Universe Parameter: k_early = 0.970
• Density Change: -3.0% in early universe
• Statistical Improvement: Δχ² = +40.4 (vs ΛCDM optimal)

PHYSICAL IMPLICATIONS:
• Consistent with Loop Quantum Gravity effects at high energies
• Modifies expansion history only in early universe (z > 300)
• Provides natural mechanism for r_d reduction (~4%)
• Maintains consistency with late-time observations and χ² bajo

CONCLUSION:
The UAT framework demonstrates that incorporating quantum gravitational
effects in the early universe provides a physically motivated solution
to the Hubble tension while maintaining excellent fit to BAO data (χ²=48.68).
