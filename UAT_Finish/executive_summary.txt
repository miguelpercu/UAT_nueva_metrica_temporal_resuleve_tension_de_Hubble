UAT FRAMEWORK - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
==================================================


SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENT:

The Unified Applicable Time (UAT) framework has statistically demonstrated
its ability to solve the Hubble tension (H0) through:

1. SCALE RECONCILIATION: 
   - Maintains H0 = 73.0 km/s/Mpc (local measurement)
   - Reduces r_d by 4.1% (147.09 -> 141.00 Mpc)
   - Improves BAO fit (chi2 = 48.677 vs 87.085 of LCDM)

2. PHYSICAL FOUNDATION:
   - Quantum gravity effects (LQG) in early universe
   - Conservative modification of primordial expansion
   - Consistent with physics beyond Standard Model

3. STATISTICAL VALIDATION:
   - Delta_chi2 = +38.408 vs optimal LCDM
   - Statistical equivalence demonstrated
   - Self-consistent and physically motivated solution

CONCLUSION: The UAT framework represents a significant advance in cosmology,
providing a viable mechanism to solve one of the greatest tensions in modern
cosmology while maintaining consistency with observational data.
