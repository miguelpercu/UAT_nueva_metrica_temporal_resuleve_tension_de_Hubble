UAT RESEARCH ROADMAP
==================================================

RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS:
1. Publication in peer-reviewed journal
2. Extension to CMB data (Planck, SPT, ACT)
3. Bayesian analysis for model comparison
4. Implementation in Boltzmann codes (CAMB, CLASS)
5. Study of implications for inflation and dark matter
6. Predictions for future observatories (Roman, Euclid)

SUGGESTED TIMELINE:
- Month 1-3: Manuscript preparation and peer review
- Month 4-6: Extension to complete CMB analysis
- Month 7-12: Implementation in standard cosmological codes
